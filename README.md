# BFS-DFS
I did not create the application.py file, it was provided to me by my instructor but it is necessary for understanding this project.
scrape.py contains a Scraper class, which was created to scrape through a number of html webpages in a scavenger hunt to find a password
in order to access two scrape-able dataframes. These passwords were hidden in a breadth-first and a depth-first search through the 
links listed on each page. This was a fun introductory project on selenium, the difference between a BFS and a DFS, as well as the use of list and deque,
buttons, and scraping data from an html table.
